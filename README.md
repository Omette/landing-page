# landing-page
This is the Landing Page I made following The Odin Project's foundations course.

I tried to utilize flexbox as much as I can, as well as apply a lot of the CSS knowledge I've acquired over the course.
I found out how to round edges as well. I tried to use classes in a few different ways. In the future, I could clean the CSS up a bit by
bundling up commot attributes between classes. I also should try using children and such more.
